## Reflection

This assignment was a valuable step forward in my development as a data professional. It allowed me to explore the practicality and impact that APIs can offer to businesses making possible to obtain real-time data collection on any topic related to a given website.

I gained a deeper understanding of the intrinsic limitations of APIs, especially around authentication, which opens the door for more complex and secure analysis. I also improved my perspective as a developer by considering the final user experience, thinking ahead about potential issues and how to troubleshoot them effectively.

Working with .json formats helped me expand my skills with Pandas, particularly in data wrangling, as JSON isn't always the most analysis-friendly structure. Additionally, I improved my ability to create clear and intuitive documentation using Markdown, which is essential for communicating insights.

Overall, this was a rewarding experience that strengthened my technical and analytical abilities. I look forward to applying this knowledge in future projects.
